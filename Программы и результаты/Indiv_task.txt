London Bridge is falling down,
Falling down, falling down.
London Bridge is falling down,
My fair lady. 

Build it up with sticks and stones, 
Sticks and stones, sticks and stones, 
Build it up with sticks and stones, 
My fair lady.

Sticks and stones will all fall down,
All fall down, all fall down.
Sticks and stones will all fall down,
My fair lady.

Build it up with wood and clay,
Wood and clay, wood and clay,
Build it up with wood and clay,
My fair lady.

Wood and clay will wash away,
Wash away, wash away.
Wood and clay will wash away, 
My fair lady.

Build it up with iron and steel,
Iron and steel, iron and steel,
Build it up with iron and steel,
My fair lady.

Iron and steel will bend and bow,
Bend and bow, bend and bow,
Iron and steel will bend and bow,
My fair lady.

Build it up with bricks so sure,
Bricks so sure, bricks so sure,
Build it up with bricks so sure,
My fair lady.

It will stand forevermore,
Evermore, evermore.
It will stand forevermore,
My fair lady.
